    Crime Management System, here's my small website created by me to practice my HTML, CSS, PHP and SQL.
  </p>
  <h2>Usage</h2>
  <p>
    Here in this site you can post your complaints and check status of your complaints by Acknowledgement number which will be sent by the admin to your email and see the details of your complaint. The officials will update your complaint as they resolve the case.
